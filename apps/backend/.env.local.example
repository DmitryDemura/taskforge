# Use this file when running backend locally (not in Docker)
# Copy to .env.local and modify as needed

# Redis Configuration - localhost with alternative port to avoid conflicts
REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6380"

# API Configuration
PORT=2999
NODE_ENV=development

# Notes:
# - This configuration assumes you are running Redis via docker-compose.local.yml
# - Alternative port (6380) helps avoid conflicts with local installations
